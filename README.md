## Details

This repo contains a working workday calendar application that lets the user type in hourly tasks or events. The applications employs local storage to ensure continuity in using the calendar. The application indicates the current, past and future hour of the day through colorblocking derived from a javascript third party API called Luxon. You can find more documentation on Luxon here: https://moment.github.io/luxon/. 

This application was created for a homework assignment in the Georgia Tech fullstack development bootcamp. We were provided with an HTML and CSS file to start that contained styling CSS classes and a framework for the HTML page including prebuilt links for bootstrap styling and a pre-built layout for the header section without the dynamically generated date.

As the developer, I coded the layout of the calendar page, created the dynamically generated date at the top of the page, and custom-scripted all the JS functionality. I took advantage of jQuery and local storage to complete the JS portion of the application.
